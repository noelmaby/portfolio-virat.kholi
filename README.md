# Portfolio - Virat Kholi

As a beginner in the vast world of web development, I am thrilled to present this project as a milestone in my learning journey. With the magic of Bootstrap, I've managed to create a website that adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, making it accessible and user-friendly across devices.

Throughout this experience, I've dived into the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, overcoming challenges, and embracing the joys of coding. While this website may be simple, it represents my determination to grow as a web developer and build remarkable digital experiences.

Thank you for being a part of my journey! Feel free to explore, and I hope you enjoy your time on my responsive creation. Your feedback and support mean the world to me.
